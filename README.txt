This folder contains the source codes related to the manuscript:

G. Q. \'Alvarez and E. G. Birgin, A first-order regularized
approach to the order-value optimization problem, submitted.

All codes needed to reproduce the numerical experiments in the paper
are included. The third party codes Algencan 3.1.1, and some Python 
libraries that will be specified below. To run the codes, a MacOS 
operating system or any Linux distribution is required. Codes were 
implemented in Fortran 90. Tests were conducted on a computer with a 
3.9 GHz AMD Ryzen 5 5600G processor and 32GB 3200 MHz DDR3 RAM memory, 
running Windows 11 Pro and a Windows Subsystem for Linux with Debian 
GNU/Linux 11.
